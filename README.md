Lab01 uses top-level-entity.vhdl and bcd_7segment.vhdl on the DE1-SoC board. What is does is depending on the Switches 0-3 the hex value is outputed on the 7 segment display.

Lab02 used top-level-entity.vhdl, bsc_7segment.vhdl, and add_bothSW.vhdl on the DE1-SoC board. What is does is output Switches 4-7 as hex on 7 segment display #4 and Switches 0-3 as hex on 7 segment display #2. It then takes these 2 hex values and outputs them on 7 segment display #1 and #0.
